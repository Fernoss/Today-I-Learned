# Today-I-Learned
A web development project that combines basics of JS, HTML, CSS.

First we use HTML to build the skeleton.

Then with CSS we style it and make the layout.

We use Supabase to create online db and API for our application data.

Then we build the web app with React.

Finally, we deploy the final project to a free service called Netlify.
